# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project - Data Analysis in R

This repositary is used for a course project for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.

I have used the following scripts/files to process the final data from the given dataset. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
The dataset is downloaded from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones under the name of `UCI HAR Dataset`. 

# Files used in the project:  
- `run_analysis.R` - The R script is used to clean, process and construct a final tidy dataset from the downloaded data.

- `CodeBook.md` - A descriptive file used to store operations that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations performed on the original dataset.

- `FinalDataset.txt` - The final tidy dataset created from the operations mentioned in the codebook file.
